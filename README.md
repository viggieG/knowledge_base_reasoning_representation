# HW 3 - Knowledge Base


## Overview

This is a two-part homework. Please read on __VERY CAREFULLY__ to understand the requirements of each part.

In Part 1, you would ideally be creating a basic knowledge base (KB) to store and retrieve facts. You would then test it before moving on to Part 2. __However,__ we have removed that requirement and supplied you with code for Part 1 already implemented. __NEVERTHELESS, it is absolutely critically important__ that you still test the implementation as described in Part 1 so you understand how to implement things in Part 2. Skipping the testing in Part 1 is almost guaranteed to result in your being lost in Part 2. __Therefore,__ please read the Part 1 description as if you were to implement things there, and understand what need to be tested and how. The description is also written as if you were to do the implementation.

In Part 2, you are going to extend the KB and create an inference engine.
